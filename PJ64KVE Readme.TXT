What's new on v0.13 KVE

- Full Windows XP (32 and 64 bit) and Windows Vista (32 and 64 bit) support.
- Jabo Direct3D8 video Plugin as default.
- Minor bug fixes.
- Windows XP and Vista players play online together without problems.


What's new on v0.13
- You can use different input plugins for online games.
- Keyboard shorcuts fixed for online games, although i wouldn't use the fullscreen (Alt + Enter) because most probably it would make you lose connection...
- Now the host (the 1st player) controls the cheats that will be used in the game.
- You can send the chat messages using Ctrl+M while playing.
- The emulator doesn't crash when the host presses the "Cancel" button, or a player presses the "Leave" button on the kaillera window =)


Known issues:
- When open the kaillera window, the following plugins will be loaded:
  Jabo's Direct3D7 1.40 (Jabo_Direct3D7.dll)
  Azimer's Audio v0.30 (Old Driver) (AudioHLE.dll)
- Use of controllers' plugins (mempak, rumblepak, etc) is not compatible for netplay games.
- Adaptoid's plugin doesn't work online, although the adaptoid can be used with Jabo's plugin.
- The emulator crashes if the kaillera window is closed while an online game is being played =(
- Desynchronization may occur (although is not very common), so try ending the emulation and starting the game again if this happens.

Project 64KVE is based on Project64k (A modded version of Project64 w/Kaillera support), the VE (Vista Edition) is only a bug fix/port to a new Operational system.
